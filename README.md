 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a curious high school student in 2020, fascinated by the endless possibilities of the digital world. Back then, I was driven by a simple passion: the thrill of solving problems and bringing ideas to life through code. It didn’t take long for me to realize that programming wasn’t just a skill—it was a gateway to building the future.

Now, as a 19-year-old Computer Science student at university, my love for coding has only deepened. I thrive on the challenge of breaking down complex problems and finding elegant solutions, constantly pushing myself to improve. Platforms like LeetCode have become my training ground, where I sharpen my algorithmic skills and immerse myself in the art of efficient problem-solving. Beyond the individual journey, I’ve discovered the joy of collaboration—working in teams, exchanging ideas, and building things together. It’s a reminder that technology is as much about people as it is about code.

As I prepare for the challenges ahead, I’m focusing on finding a balance between my studies and my passion for learning. It won’t be without its challenges, but I know growth comes from stepping out of my comfort zone and tackling things head-on.

So here’s to the leap forward, to the dream of creating something that younger me would be proud of. Don’t wait up, because I’m just getting started.
